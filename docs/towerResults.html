                Towers. The Divine Tower of Caelid is found in Dragonbarrow. Players can reach this
                location by heading northeast from the Dragonbarrow West Site of Grace (or the
                closer Isolated Merchant in Calid). This tower cannot be accessed by conventional
                methods and will require careful platforming starting from the roots that extend
                from the Dragonbarrow plateau towards the tower's sides and using the ledges and
                ladders along the side of the tower.</p>

        <div id="isolated" class="tower">
            <h1>Isolated Divine Tower</h1>
            <p>Physically detached from the mainland the Isolated Divine Tower is the easternmost
                Divine Tower in the Lands Between. Although its great bridge was lost, it was
                associated with Shardbearer Malenia, who sealed off its entrance with her magic.
                After her defeat, however, the player can restore power to Malenia's Great Rune by
                interacting with a glowing Great Rune in front of a dormant pair of Two Fingers.</p>

                Towers. The Divine Tower of East Altus is found in Capital Outskirts. Found at the

            <h1>Divine Tower of West Altus</h1>
            <p>Divine Tower of West Altus is a Location in Elden Ring. It is one of the six Divine
                Towers. The Divine Tower of West Altus is found in Capital Outskirts between Altus
                Plateau and Leyndell, Royal Capital. It can only be reached by going through a
                series of illusory walls found in Sealed Tunnel. The path is linear, so there's no
                way to miss it, and illusory walls are generally at the end of each new area. You
                have to fight Onyx Lord which can be defeated in your first encounter if you are
                prudent enough.</p>
